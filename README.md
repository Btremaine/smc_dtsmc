* Discrete Time Sliding mode control introduction

### What is this repository for? ###

* Files to run sliding mode controller in MATLAB Simulink
* Repo v1.0.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Run init.m to initialize parameters {first select in.m file which controler to use}
* In Simulink run smc_dtsmc
* Note: when init.m is used the multiplier, d, is 1.0
* after running init you can set d=3.0 in the Matlab console
* then run smc_dtsmc. This will show the effect of 3x the mass
* with no change in the controller.
